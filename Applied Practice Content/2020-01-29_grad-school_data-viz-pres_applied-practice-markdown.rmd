# Practice Datasets

Feel free to use your own data or peruse the available practice datasets and documentation below.

Data were selected for their variance to support several approaches to data visualization.

Some datasets are moderately large, others are quite small, but all are clean.

* Variable names are formatted for case, punctuation, and descriptiveness
* Datetimes have been formatted to ISO format and parsed on both `Month` and `Year`
* Coordinate values are concatenated and parsed for all possible longitude-latitude permutations

<br>

**It's up to you to find the stories in the data.**

# Connecting to Data Studio

*Google Data Studio* is a point-and-click, drag-and-drop application for creating interactive reporting tools.

In order to create a report and connect your data, you must:

1. Sign into your *Google* account
2. Copy or upload a *Google Sheets* table to your *Google Drive*
3. Create a new report in *Google Data Studio* (with one click)
4. Select your connection application (*Google Sheets*)
5. Make sure your variables are the correct class and add your new "connection"

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Copy an Existing Dataset

Open up a dataset in *Google Sheets*.  

1. Click "File" and "Make a copy..." (see *Step 1.1*)
2. Make sure "Folder" is set to "My Drive" (see *Step 1.2*)
3. Click "OK"

<br>

<center>

**Step 1.1: Select "Make a copy..." in "File"**

<br>

<br>

**Step 1.2: Make sure "Folder" is set to "My Drive" and click "OK"**

<br>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Create & Connect Reports

In order to create a new report and connect it to your data, visit the [**Data Studio home page**](https://datastudio.google.com/).

1. Click "Start a New Report" (see *Step 2.1*)
2. Select "Create New Data Source" (see *Step 2.2*)
3. Select your connection method (see *Step 2.3*)

<br>

<center>

**Step 2.1: Click "Start a New Report"**

<br>

![](C:/Users/jcrawford52/Documents/GitHub/dataviz/Applied Practice Content/images/connect_step-1.jpg)

<br>

**Step 2.2: Click "Create New Data Source"**

<br>

![](C:/Users/jcrawford52/Documents/GitHub/dataviz/Applied Practice Content/images/connect_step-2.jpg)

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Edit Your Connection

It's the final stretch. You just have to choose your table and check your variables.

1. Select the spreadsheet, worksheet, and options from *Google Sheets* (see *Step 3.1*)
2. Click "OK", then check that the "Type" of each variable is correct (see *Step 3.2*)
3. Click "Add to Report"

<br>

<center>

**Step 3.1: Select the correct "Spreadsheet" (B) and options (D)**

<br>

![](C:/Users/jcrawford52/Documents/GitHub/dataviz/Applied Practice Content/images/edit_step-1.jpg)

<br>

**Step 3.2: Check each variable "Type" and select "Add to Report"**

# Visualization Resources

The following are just a few resources for creating effective visualizations with any tooling.

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Extracting Colors

[**HTML Color Codes**](https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/) allows you to upload images and logos to extract their precise colors.

<br>

<center>

![](C:/Users/jcrawford52/Documents/GitHub/dataviz/Applied Practice Content/images/tips_1.jpg)

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Generate Color Palettes

[**Coolers**](https://coolors.co/) is an excellent tool for generating complementary and gradient color palettes. 

<br>

<center>

![](C:/Users/jcrawford52/Documents/GitHub/dataviz/Applied Practice Content/images/tips_2.jpg)

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Mind Accessibility

If using light fonts or dark backgrounds, ensure the contrast is still visually-accessible with [**WebAIM**](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

<br>

<center>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Fonts

Though **Google Data Studio** fonts are limited, they're extremeley legible. 

Consider downloading some font families to complement your reports and presentations in [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/).

Tuesday's presentation used "Quicksand" - it's dope. You can easily look up how to install new fonts.
